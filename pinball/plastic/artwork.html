Separate color matching software often comes with   a new monitor, as well.<p> Scanning software: Usually comes with the scanner<h4> Hardware:</h4><p> Flatbed scanner, at least 600 x 600 dpi unenhanced <p>If you're going to be editing images of any size, you'll want to have a fast   computer with lots of RAM. As a minimum, I'd recommend 200 MHz/32 Mb (PC) or   166 MHz/32 Mb (Mac). <p> Video: It is <b>ESSENTIAL</b> to use at least a <b>24-bit</b> color video   mode. 32,768 colors (<b>15-bit</b>, or <b>Thousands</b> on the Mac) is not good   enough. On a Windows machine, you can set this in the <b>Desktop Properties</b>   dialog. On a Mac, you should use the <b>Monitors &amp; Sound</b> control panel   to choose <b>Millions</b> of colors (which is 32-bit, by the way.) <p> Printer: I strongly recommend that you somehow get access to a color laser   printer, 600 dpi or better. 24-hour copy stores like Kinkos will often rent   time on one. You can try using a color ink jet printer, but you will probably   find that the ink does not dry evenly, and that it runs together too much to   be useful for printing on transparencies.<p> Transparencies: These should be the ones designed for the specific printer   you are using. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the proper way to insert   them into the printer, since mistakes can be very expensive.<p> White paint: I used Testor's flat white paint, applied with an airbrush. You   can probably use any solvent-based white paint, even in an aerosol can. Stay   away from water-based paints, as they dry too slowly and may cause the laser   toner to lift up.<p> Sealer: Any polyurethane or other varnish should work, as long as it remains   flexible when dry. It doesn't matter if it's glossy or flat, though satin or   flat probably come closest to the real thing. I used Varathane Diamond Coat   with good results. This can be brushed on, or sprayed, but be careful with aerosol   varnish as it may contain solvents that dissolve the white paint underneath.<p> Other supplies: Boxboard (non-corrugated cardboard) for mockups; hobby (X-Acto)   knife or scissors; paper glue (like Uhu) or rubber cement <p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"><a name="sca"></a> <h3 align="center"> Scanning</h3><p> The way you scan the image will vary greatly depending on the scanning software,   but here are some general hints: <ul>  <li> Be sure to scan in full-color (at least 15-bit), not 256 colors.</li>  <li> Use a dpi setting of 300. More than that will give too much detail and     probably slow down your computer too much when touching up. Less than that     will probably not give an accurate enough reproduction.</li>  <li> The most common software I've seen, HP's Desk Scan II, handles dpi settings     very badly, in my opinion. In order to get a true 300 dpi scan, you have to     create a custom setting. Don't be fooled by the preconfigured setting which     says &quot;300 dpi&quot;, because that's really going to scan at 150!<br>    <font color="#333399">[Wilga's postulate: Hardware manufacturers should never     attempt to write software. When they do, they invariably make important options     hard to get to, they make the esoteric options confusing, they use too much     industry-specific lingo, and it's almost always tied together with a nonstandard     user interface. Printer control panels, hard disk and printer drivers, and     the like are prime examples of the validity of this postulate.]</font></li>  <li> Some sharpening is probably OK to include in the scanning, but Photoshop     gives you more control over the degree, so you might just want to leave this     off in the scanning software.</li>  <li> The colors levels won't be correct anyway, so don't even bother trying     to adjust the brightness/contrast here. Just set them to something that produces     a reasonable result.</li>  <li> If you are scanning a plastic that has a post permanently sticking out     of the top side, like the &quot;Drive 55&quot; on High Speed, you can prop-up     the plastic with something of the same height as the post, holding it away     from the bed of the scanner &quot;on legs&quot;. This will produce a slightly     blurrier scan than if the plastic is placed directly on the bed, but it does     work.</li></ul><p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"> <h3 align="center"><a name="tu"></a>Touching-up</h3><p> Once you've got the image scanned, you'll definitely want to spend time cleaning   it up. You'll want to even out the color variations -- particularly around the   edges, where the scanner will have been looking at the edge of the plastic.   You'll also want to remove any scratches and fill-in and holes for posts.<p> Before you do anything else, make sure you are in the correct editing mode.   In Photoshop, you should be in <b>CMYK</b> mode. Other programs may call it   other things, or may only have an RGB mode, but the basic idea is the same:   don't limit yourself to a small number of colors. CMYK mode is preferable to   RGB because it will only let you use colors that can be reproduced using the   four primary colors used in a laser printer (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.)<p> <a href="spots.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>The   next thing to do is to mark where the posts go. If your editor has the ability   to create a layer which sits above the main image, like Photoshop does, do so.   Draw solid circles using a contrasting color, like bright red or green, in this   layer. Make them slightly smaller than the existing holes, because the holes   in plastics are almost always enlarged from wear. Besides, you can always drill   the holes in the plastic bigger if you need to. <p> If the original plastic has holes that are not used for anything, you can   leave them out of this layer and fill them in while retouching.<p> Next, you'll want to define the overall shape of the plastic. This is especially   important if there is a section missing from it, but it's also very helpful   to do right now because it allows you to draw outside the lines and then easily   remove the extra pixels later on. <p> <a href="path.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>In   Photoshop, you define the shape with a <b>Path</b>. This tool allows you to   create a series of mathematical curves and lines that form a shape. Since the   plastics on newer pinball machines are obviously designed on a computer, you'll   probably find it fairly easy to fit these curves, once you're familiar with   how the tools work. If you've never drawn with vectors before, I strongly recommend   you read the manual that comes with your program. <p> <a href="pathpop.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>When   you create the path (in Photoshop), be sure you use the <b>New Path</b> command   to start with, rather than using the <b>Work Path</b>. This type of path is   more permanent than a Work Path. <p> <img src="croptool.gif" align="right" hspace="10">Once you have defined the   path, you can speed things up by getting rid of the extra space around the image.   Use the <b>Crop</b> tool to define a rectangle that is just a little larger   (by, say, 10 to 20 pixels) than the image itself. <p> <a href="makesel.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>Now   select the path in the <b>Paths</b> palette and choose <b>Make Selection</b>   from the options. In this dialog, use the settings shown in the picture. Select   the command <b>Select -&gt; Inverse</b> from the menus to invert the selection.   If you have other plastics in this same image, you will have to adjust the selection   using the lasso or marquee tool. Go to <b>Edit -&gt; Fill</b> and tell it to   fill the selection with the background color. This will get rid of any extra   dots around the image of the plastic, and will speed up further editing. <p> Now you can start to correct the image. Here are some hints: <ul>  <li> Save often. There's nothing more frustrating than coming to the realization     that you just did something major to the image that can no longer be undone     with the <b>Undo</b> command.</li>  <li> Plastics generally use only a handful of colors, and they are often applied     in regular geometric shapes. Use the eyedropper tool to get an average of     the color at a given area, and fill-in large areas with this color. (Hint:     on the Mac <b>Control-click</b> and hold, on the PC <b>right click</b>; a     popup menu will appear from which you can select the <b>3x3</b> or <b>5x5</b>     sample size.) You can save this color as a swatch for use later in other areas     of the plastic (or for other plastics on the same machine).</li>  <li> In general, you should try to make all areas that are white or clear completely     white in the image, not some shade of off-white.</li>  <li> If you have an area where the plastic is completely white or clear, and     this area extends all the way to the edge of the plastic, you'll need to create     a fine colored line along the edge. Otherwise, you won't know where to cut     the transparency later on.</li>  <li> To generate smooth transitions between colors, use the <b>Blur <img src="blur.gif" width="26" height="22" align="absmiddle"></b>     or <b>Smudge</b> <img src="smudge.gif" width="25" height="22" align="absmiddle">     tool. When creating shapes from scratch, make sure the <b>Anti-alias</b> option     is turned on.</li>  <li> Be sure to fix the outer edges of the plastic. They will most likely need     to be repainted, because the scanner sees the edge of a plastic as a slightly     different color. Don't worry about going outside the outer edge; you can clear     that up later on using the path created earlier.</li>  <li> Fill-in the areas around post holes where the image will be somewhat distorted.     As I said before, you can always drill a hole bigger if you need to, but you     can't make it smaller.</li>  <li> Sometimes it will be better to use paths to recreate large areas of the     image from scratch, rather than retouching. This can take a while to do, but     the results are far better. I'll leave the exact procedure for you to figure     out, but essentially it involves turning paths into selections and then filling     those selected areas.</li></ul><h4> <a name="wai"></a>Why am I replacing this piece in the first place?</h4><p> This is a question you should ask yourself. Is it because the original plastic   has broken in a vulnerable place? If so, then you might want to look for reasons   why this happens and try to correct them. <p> <a href="fhbreak.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>For   instance on Funhouse, the blue plastic atop the Tunnel hole and eject scoop   frequently gets broken because the welds on the back of the scoop break and   the top of the scoop pushes up into the plastic, breaking it at a place where   it is very narrow. The solution in this case is to shore-up the back of the   scoop from underneath the playfield, so that it will not bend upward so much.   You could also remove some of the plastic closest to the scoop, but that just   makes the new plastic weaker. <p> If a plastic is getting damaged from frequent airballs, look for a nearby   spot target that has become bent backward. Replace the target or brace it with   a piece of metal from underneath if this is the case.<p> <a href="slot.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>If   the plastic is vulnerable to being broken from having a hole for a post that   is too close to an edge, see if the shape of the plastic can be made larger   to give a greater distance to the edge. Failing that, consider making the place   for the post more of a slot than a hole. (See the image for an example.) <h4> <a name="moc"></a>Mockups</h4><p> It is a very good idea to do at least one mockup of your plastic to make sure   that its shape is correct and that its holes are in the correct locations. You   can print this on regular paper using even a black-and-white laser printer;   there's no need for color yet. Glue the paper image to boxboard using a glue   that does not warp paper too much, like Uhu or rubber cement. Cut the images   out, make any needed holes using a hobby knife, and fit the mockup to the posts   of the actual pinball machine. Alter the shapes of your plastics and the locations   of the holes on the computer image as needed. <h4> <a name="cm"></a>Color matching</h4><p> The most time-consuming aspect of creating images using a computer is getting   the printer to produce the same colors as the original plastic. There are two   stages in matching colors. I'll discuss the first stage here, getting the computer   monitor to match the real world.<p> One word of advice: if at all possible, try to use the same monitor, lighting   conditions, and color matching software for both the computer that you are using   to edit the bitmap image and the one that is going to be doing the printing.   This will make matching the colors much easier.<p> Color calibration can be greatly affected by the amount of light in the room.   If you have windows in the room, a bright sunny day will cause the real world   image to look very different from the way it would at night. When calibrating,   try to choose a setup that is an average of the light levels under which you'll   be working on the image.<p> If your monitor comes with color matching software, use it. For instance,   Apple's AppleVision monitors come with a color calibration tool that you hold   up to the monitor and then compare with color swatches in the Monitors &amp;   Sound control panel. Other monitors offer similar tools. <h5> <a name="mcc"></a>Manual color calibration</h5><p> If you do not have color calibration tools, you're not completely out of luck.   You'll need three things: a piece of white paper, a piece of solid black paper,   and a reference to compare with, like a Pantone color book. You may be able   to borrow a Pantone book from a print shop or copy store. <p> Start by adjusting the &quot;white point&quot; of your monitor. Set the monitor   to full contrast, and put the brightness at a comfortable level. Hold the piece   of white paper up to the screen and adjust the monitor's RGB levels until the   color of the paper exactly matches a white area on the screen. <p> You can adjust the levels in one of three ways: on the monitor itself, through   software provided with the monitor or video card (try <b>Display Properties</b>   on a PC), or in Photoshop's <b>File -&gt; Color Settings -&gt; Monitor Setup</b>   command. The PC version of Photoshop has much better controls than the Mac version   where this is concerned. The best way available to me on the PC happened to   be my ATI video card which allowed me to set the levels for red, green, and   blue by defining a curve, not simply by raising or lowering the levels. <p> Having defined the white point, you may also have the option of adjusting   the black point, depending on what method you have to use to adjust the levels.   This is what the piece of black paper is for. <p> The color reference is for making fine adjustments to the color settings.   If you are able to borrow a Pantone book, you can make direct comparisons between   it and the reference colors in Photoshop. Click on the color chip and choose   <b>Custom</b>. You'll see that the Pantone colors here are arranged just like   the pages in the Pantone book. You can hold the book right up to your monitor   and make adjustments to the color settings until the two match. Be sure to check   various intensities of reds, blues, and greens. <p> You will probably find that the monitor looks much darker now that it has   been calibrated this way, and that white looks more like brown. Your eyes will   adjust, believe me. <p> After you have calibrated the monitor to the real world, you can adjust the   colors of your bitmap image so that they match the original plastic. Just hold   the plastic up to the monitor and fiddle with the image's color until it matches.   You will probably find the controls in <b>Images -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Hue/Saturation</b>   helpful here. You can select the areas of the image that are of one color using   either the <b>magic wand</b> or <b>Select -&gt; Color Range</b>. All of these   tools can take some getting used to, so be patient and remember to use <b>Undo</b>   if you don't like the results. <p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"><a name="pr"></a><h3 align="center"> Printing</h3><h4> <a name="cs"></a>Conserving supplies</h4><p> Color laser toner is very expensive, as are the transparencies you'll be printing   on. Printing a full-page color image can also take a long time for the data   to reach the printer. So keep these tips in mind: <ul>  <li> When laying out the page to be printed, put as many plastics on the page     as possible. You can't run a transparency through the printer a second time,     so give yourself extra copies of the image to play with. You can even fill-in     some of the small, unused areas with clippings from the full plastics. These     make for good throwaway test areas to see if the white paint you're using     will harm the toner. Just be sure to leave enough space between images (about     1/8 inch) so that you can get a pair of scissors in there to cut the transparency.</li>  <li> When doing color matching test prints, limit yourself to small areas of     each color used in the plastic. There's probably no need to print the entire     image at all, until you're ready for the final output. And don't use expensive,     coated paper either. The cheap stuff works just fine for testing.</li></ul><h4> <a name="cam"></a>Create a mirror image</h4><p> One important thing you have to do before making your final printout is to   reverse the image. In Photoshop, you do this with <b>Image -&gt; Rotate Canvas   -&gt; Flip Horizontal</b> (or <b>Vertical</b>). <p> The reason for this is that we are going to be adhering the smooth side (the   side without toner) to the plastic. This is because we do not want the glue   to harm the toner. Purists will probably also like the fact that having the   toner on the underside of the plastic produces the same sort of &quot;embossed&quot;   look on the underside as the original silk-screened plastic. <h4> <a name="cm2"></a>Color matching</h4><p> Now comes part two of the color matching saga: getting the printer to accurately   reproduce what you see on the monitor. Unless you are working at a professional   design house, the printer is most likely not calibrated correctly. Even the   age of the toner cartridges can have a significant effect on the color of the   output.<p> Create a small test image (about 2 inches square) that has areas representing   all of the major colors in your plastics. Print this out, and be prepared to   be amazed if it actually matches the real plastic. <p> <a href="xfer.html"><img src="pic.gif" width="31" height="26" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>Assuming   it doesn't match, it's time to adjust the printer driver's settings. On the   Mac, you do this by going to <b>File -&gt; Page Setup -&gt; Adobe Photoshop   -&gt; Transfer</b>. The settings here are similar to the <b>Image -&gt; Adjust   -&gt; Curves</b> dialog, so refer to that section of the Photoshop manual for   more details. <p> I don't have access to a color laser attached to a PC, but I believe the setup   dialog would be in a similar location.<p> Keep doing test prints until the colors match. If you find that adjusting   one color is causing another to vary away from what it should be, you may have   to make a change in the image's colors instead. Try to avoid this if you can,   though. <p> When you think you have all of the colors the way they should be, do a printout   of the actual image. On the Mac, you have to save the transfer settings to a   file and load them into the image of the plastic, because the page settings   are held separately for each document. <i>Save at least one full-page test printout   for use later on!</i> <p> Once you've verified that the full-page test image is correct, you can do   the final printout on transparency. Be sure to read the instructions that come   with the transparency and/or printer concerning the proper way to load the transparency   into the printer. Putting it in the wrong way can cause a jam on some printers. <p> Be very careful when handling this sheet after it has been printed. Toner   will pull away from a transparency much more easily than paper, and there may   even be small &quot;bubbles&quot; of toner that flake away. <p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"> <h3 align="center"> <a name="fin"></a>Finishing</h3><p> Now that you've successfully printed the artwork, you have to paint it white.   For this I use Testor's flat white model paint, applied with an airbrush. You   can probably use any solvent-based white paint, even in an aerosol can. Stay   away from water-based paints, as they dry too slowly and may cause the laser   toner to lift up. Experiment on a test piece to make sure the toner will not   be affected. <p> If there are to be clear areas that are not painted white, you should mask   them off before painting. Clear packing tape would probably work for this, but   I have not had to do this yet so I can't say for sure. Essentially, it needs   to be something that can be removed later without denting the transparency,   and cut easily with a hobby knife. <p> Apply 2-3 even coats of paint, directly onto the toner side of the transparency.   You may find it helpful to tape the sheet down so that it will not curl as you   are painting. Let the final coat dry for at least an entire day before going   on to the next step.<p> Now you need to seal the white paint and toner from scratches and damage from   hot GI bulbs. To do this, use a coat of polyurethane or other varnish. The important   thing is that the sealer you choose must be flexible when dry. (Try it on one   of your small test pieces.) It doesn't matter if it's glossy or flat, though   satin or flat probably come closest to the real thing. I used Varathane Diamond   Coat with good results. This can be brushed on, or sprayed, but be careful with   aerosol varnish as it may contain solvents that dissolve the white paint underneath.<p> Let this dry completely before going on to mount the artwork. <p align="center">[ <a href="index.html">Contents</a> | <a href="plastic.html">Plastic</a>   ]<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/copyright.lbi" --><p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"> <p align="center"> <font size="2">Entire article and photographs copyright &copy;   1998 Dan Wilga.
