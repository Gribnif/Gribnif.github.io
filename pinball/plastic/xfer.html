If, for instance, you noticed that something purple   was looking somewhat washed-out, you might increase the level of magenta as   shown above. For a good idea of what components will affect which color, experiment   with the saturation controls in <b>Images -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Hue/Saturation</b>.<p>This dialog is accessed by going to <b>File -&gt; Page Setup -&gt; Adobe Photoshop   -&gt; Transfer</b>.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/copyright.lbi" --><p align="center"><img src="ruler2.gif"> <p align="center"> <font size="2">Entire article and photographs copyright &copy;   1998 Dan Wilga.
